  Oil prices will drop even more (by about $10) which highly helps western economies and negatively impacts oil exporting countries.

<li class="font_8">
  Countries that see most of the boost in trade with Iran are Britain, China, India, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia.
</li>
<li class="font_8">
  Iran will enjoy an estimated $15 billion increase in oil revenues in the first year after sanctions are liftedd and will received about $107 billion worth of its frozen assets (not all of it is expected to be released immediately.
