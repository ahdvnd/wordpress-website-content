I've been thinking about what explains this cyclical trends in search for the term "inequality" in Google. As you can search for inequality has been rising since sometime around 2011 but it fluctuates between peaking in November/December and a troughing in July of each year. Is it because of seasonal ups-and-downs in Google search in general?
