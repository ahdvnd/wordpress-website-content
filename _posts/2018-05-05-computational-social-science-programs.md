Computational Social Science is a vast field and does not have a clear definition. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyZkptxlSA8) might help. If I'm missing something make a pull request [here](https://github.com/ahdvnd/wordpress-website-content/blob/master/_posts/2018-05-05-computational-social-science-programs.md).
