</p> [/intro] I'm currently a Post-Doctoral Scholar at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health][1]. My current research involves analyzing MOOC data and the effectiveness of a job training program in Baltimore, MD and I'm working with the great [Jeff Leek][2]. I received my Ph.D. degree in economics from [the Graduate Center, CUNY][3] in June 2017. I have a master’s degree in economics from Texas Tech University and a master’s degree in control systems and a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology in Tehran, Iran. One of my main interests in life is teaching. During the past few years, I’ve been teaching various courses in both undergraduate and graduate levels at Barnard College (of Columbia University), Brooklyn College (of CUNY), Yeshiva University, and Texas Tech University. You can contact me [here][4] or DM [@ahdvnd][5]. 

My research interests are:
* Economics of Education (especially online education)
* Economic Inequality
* The Gig Economy
* Replicability and Reproducibility in Scientific Research [social_icon_wrap] [social_icon type="twitter" url="https://twitter.com/ahdvnd"] [social_icon type="linkedin" url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aboozar-hadavand-14a170103"] [social_icon type="facebook" url="https://www.facebook.com/aboozar.hadavand"] [social_icon type="github" url="https://github.com/ahdvnd"] [/social_icon_wrap] [latest_from_the_blog items="50" category_slug="" meta=""] <!--[latest_from_the_blog items="10"]-->
