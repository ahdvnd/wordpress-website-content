</p> [/intro] I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at 

[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health][1]. My current research involves analyzing MOOC data and the effectiveness of a job training program in Baltimore, MD and I'm working with the great [Jeff Leek][2]. I received my Ph.D. in economics from [the Graduate Center, CUNY][3] in June 2017. I am in the job market this year and I'll be available during the AEA 2019. You can contact me [here][4] or DM [@ahdvnd][5]. My research interests are: * Economics of Education (especially online education) * Student behavior in MOOCs * Economic Inequality * The Gig Economy * Replicability and Reproducibility in Scientific Research [social_icon_wrap] [social_icon type="twitter" url="https://twitter.com/ahdvnd"] [social_icon type="linkedin" url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aboozar-hadavand-14a170103"] [social_icon type="github" url="https://github.com/ahdvnd"] [/social_icon_wrap]<!--[latest_from_the_blog items="10"]-->
